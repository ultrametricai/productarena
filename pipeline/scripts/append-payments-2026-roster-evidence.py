# Payments 2026-roster bring-up (2026-09-15): checkout-com, mollie, airwallex, paddle, polar
# debut against incumbents that already carry exhaustive agent-surface evidence packs (the
# Stripe spike, commit 771a7510, and the fairness wave, commit 277a7797). This script applies
# the SAME supplement recipe to the newcomers from day one: verbatim passages from
# CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor pages that the per-source extraction caps plus the story quota
# starved out of the packs even though the crawled corpus (pipeline/cache/crawl/payments/<id>/)
# contains them verbatim, plus live keyless probes that fail loudly if reality changes.
#
# Every URL below is in that product's products.json urls; every excerpt quotes the crawled
# page (crawl and authoring on the same day, 2026-09-15).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - checkout-com: no official CLI; no llms-full corpus and no `.md` page mirrors (the docs
#     site is HTML-only; llms.txt indexes it); no in-product dashboard assistant documented.
#   - mollie: no official CLI; no agentic-commerce (ACP/UCP) participation documented; no
#     in-product assistant; MCP is documented for merchants, not a docs-search MCP.
#   - airwallex: no ACP/UCP seller-side catalog protocol documented; MoR is beta and
#     digital-products-only (quoted as such).
#   - paddle: no official CLI; no seller-side agentic-commerce protocol documented; Retain
#     dunning "works with live data... you can't integrate or test with sandbox accounts"
#     (quoted as-is).
#   - polar: no official CLI; no agentic-commerce protocol; payouts are manual/threshold-based
#     via Stripe Connect — nothing quoted beyond what the docs say.
#   - openness-*/privacy-*: only what the crawled pages state; no agent-washing of other axes.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline probe --category payments --product <id>` (that stage wholesale-
# replaces probe-tier items; this script's probe items must be re-appended if it re-runs) and
# AFTER extract (extraction is monotonic and dedups by normalized excerpt).

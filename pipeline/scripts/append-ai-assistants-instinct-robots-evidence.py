# One-shot helper for the Instinct ai-assistants bring-up (founder ask 2026-10-02).
#
# Instinct (instinct.com) is invite-only and its ToS prohibits automated access to the
# Services ("any robot, spider, crawlers, scraper"), so this bring-up deliberately runs NO
# hands-on probes and NO path-fishing (no /llms.txt, /openapi.json, /docs guesses) against
# instinct.com. The ONLY direct HTTP observations recorded are the two crawler-facing
# metadata files the vendor publishes specifically for automated consumption — robots.txt
# and the sitemap it points at — each fetched once on 2026-10-02 with the pipeline's
# identified UA. robots.txt (last-modified 2026-10-02) allows ALL user-agents on ALL paths,
# which is what sanctioned the standard single-fetch crawl of the public pages (homepage,
# /terms, /privacy-policy) used for the claimed-docs tier.
#
# Run AFTER extract/collect-community (both preserve probe-tier items, but a future spike's
# probe stage wholesale-replaces the probe tier — re-run this script after any probe refresh;
# see the probe-stage-replacement gotcha).

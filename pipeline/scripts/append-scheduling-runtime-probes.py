# One-shot helper for the scheduling arena bring-up (2026-09-06): appends probe-tier evidence
# items distilled from the recorded runtime probes in data/scheduling/proofs/ (see
# pipeline/probes/scheduling.ts — all 7 recorded probes passed).
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline probe --category scheduling` — that stage wholesale-replaces
# probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items (re-run this script after any probe refresh).

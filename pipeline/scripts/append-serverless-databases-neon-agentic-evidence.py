# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15): identical supplement recipe to the Stripe agentic-
# capability spike (append-payments-stripe-agentic-evidence.py, 771a7510) and the payments
# fairness wave (append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py, 277a7797), applied to
# serverless-databases/neon. This wave's crawl added 24 agent-surface urls.extra pages
# (neon.com/auth.md agent-claim flow, the CLI's agent-setup subcommands, Agent Skills, the
# hosted MCP server's tool/scoping docs, AI Gateway, Functions-for-agents, neon.ts,
# branching-for-agents, API-key scoping, the Management API llms.txt endpoint index); the
# monotonic re-extract surfaced 18 mostly one-line items. These verbatim passages quote the
# CRAWLED pages (pipeline/cache/crawl/serverless-databases/neon/*, fetched 2026-09-15) for
# content the per-source extraction caps starved out.
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - The hosted MCP server is OAuth/API-key gated; keyless access gets only the 401 challenge
#     (that's what neon-probe-6 records — no agent-washing it into "open access").
#   - The local stdio MCP package (@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon) is DEPRECATED in favor of the
#     hosted server; quoted as such. The /sse transport is deprecated with a documented
#     2026-10-01 retirement.
#   - AI Gateway and Neon Functions are Beta and region-limited (aws-us-east-2 /
#     aws-eu-central-1); frontier models are "rolling out gradually" behind early access —
#     labels kept verbatim.
#   - SQL Editor AI shares "no actual data", schema only — quoted with its scope intact.
#   - No undocumented mcp.* hosts beyond mcp.neon.tech were found (mcp.neon.tech/mcp is the
#     documented endpoint; /api/list-tools is documented on the MCP overview page).
#   - openness-*/privacy-* axes: out of this wave's scope; no supplements added there.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --product neon` (extract is monotonic and dedups by
# normalized excerpt). If a probe stage ever wholesale-replaces probe-tier items, re-run this
# script to restore neon-probe-6/7/8.

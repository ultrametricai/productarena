# One-shot helper for the 2026-10-01 ai-assistants roster expansion (dots, grok-bot, kimi,
# perplexity-computer). Appends probe-tier evidence items distilled from the recorded runtime
# probes in data/ai-assistants/proofs/{dots,grok-bot,kimi,perplexity-computer}/ (see
# pipeline/probes/ai-assistants.ts — all eight recorded probes passed). Run AFTER
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category ai-assistants --product <id>` (or a spike pass, whose probe
# stage wholesale-replaces probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items) — re-run this script
# after any probe refresh.

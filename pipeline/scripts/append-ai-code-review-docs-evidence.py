# ai-code-review arena bring-up (2026-09-10): supplements evidence packs with verbatim passages
# from the CRAWLED vendor docs that the LLM extraction pass missed — the kitty precedent
# (append-kitty-docs-evidence.py): per-source extraction caps starve specific capabilities
# (here: the entire privacy/no-training posture of every vendor, plus CodeRabbit's dashboard
# and merge-gating pages) out of the prompt even though the crawled corpus contains them
# verbatim. Applied evenly across all six products so the fairness pass favors no one — the
# Greptile item deliberately includes the vendor's de-identified-data training carve-out.
# Every excerpt below quotes pipeline/cache/crawl/ai-code-review/<product>/*.md content
# (checked at authoring time); URLs are the crawled sources.

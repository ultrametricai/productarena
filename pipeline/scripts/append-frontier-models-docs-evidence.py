# Frontier-models arena bring-up (2026-09-22): supplements evidence packs with verbatim passages
# from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor pages that the LLM extraction passes kept missing — the
# data-warehouses/auth-platforms precedent (append-data-warehouses-docs-evidence.py): per-source
# extraction caps starve specific capabilities out of the prompt even though the corpus contains
# them verbatim (this arena's jev corpus alone is 116 crawled sources, ~500 chars each in the
# extraction prompt). Every excerpt below quotes a page in pipeline/cache/crawl/frontier-models/
# fetched 2026-09-22 (grep-verified at authoring time via .pa-tmp/find-passages.py). Honest
# negatives are included where the crawl PROVED an absence (llama's SSO-gated docs; jev's
# no-fine-tuning statement). Community-replica items attribute third-party status explicitly —
# Open-Jev replicas are NOT TypeSafe products.

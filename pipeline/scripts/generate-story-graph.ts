// Emits the story↔process connection DAG (lib/storyProcessGraph.ts's buildStoryGraph — founder ask
// 2026-09-22: "This connection between stories and processes should form a large DAG on our
// backend, so we know how everything connects") as data/graph.json, the committed public
// artifact. Ships exactly like every other data file: scripts/copy-data.mjs mirrors data/ →
// public/data/ before each build, so the graph is fetchable at /productarena/data/graph.json
// (the same mechanism the CLI's /data/categories.json reads use).
//
// Pure derivation — re-run after any corpus / mapping / verdict change; determinism against the
// committed file is enforced by lib/__tests__/storyProcessGraph.test.ts (same recompute posture as
// rankings.json vs pipeline/scripts/recompute-check.ts). No LLM, no network, no cache.
//
// Size sanity cap: the whole graph must stay under MAX_BYTES (5MB). If a future corpus pushes it
// over, this script fails loudly — the agreed split is then to keep the core DAG (process/step/
// story nodes + has-step/step-story edges) in graph.json and move story→product edges into
// per-arena files (data/graph-products/<arenaId>.json); don't raise the cap silently.
//
// Usage: tsx pipeline/scripts/generate-story-graph.ts

# One-shot helper for the security-keys arena bring-up (2026-09-15): appends probe-tier
# evidence items distilled from the recorded runtime probes in data/security-keys/proofs/
# (see pipeline/probes/security-keys.ts — all 11 recorded probes passed, two of them
# deliberate negatives). Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline probe --category security-keys` — that
# stage wholesale-replaces probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items (re-run this
# script after any probe refresh).

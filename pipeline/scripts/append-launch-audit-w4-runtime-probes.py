# Launch-audit wave 4 (2026-09-22), B5 evidence depth: appends probe-tier evidence items
# distilled from the recorded keyless probes for the claimed-docs-only products (zero prior
# probe/github-tier evidence) — muse, gemini (ai-assistants), motion (scheduling), tilled
# (marketplace-payments), notebooklm (ai-research-agents), sift (fraud-prevention),
# google-titan (security-keys), intel-core-ultra-7-258v + amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d (processors).
# Every item cites a PA_RECORD proof in data/<arena>/proofs/ (pipeline/probes/<arena>.ts);
# negatives are recorded honestly — an absence proof is still probe-tier.
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline probe --category <arena>` (and after any spike pass) — that stage
# wholesale-replaces probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items (re-run after refreshes).

# Accounting 2026-roster bring-up (2026-09-16): freshbooks, zoho-books, wave, digits, kick,
# mercury-books, bench debut against incumbents (quickbooks, xero, puzzle, pilot) that already
# carry exhaustive evidence packs. Same supplement recipe as the payments roster expansion
# (pipeline/scripts/append-payments-2026-roster-evidence.py, commit 8ca5dc78b): verbatim
# passages from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor pages that the per-source extraction caps plus the
# story quota starved out of the packs even though the crawled corpus
# (pipeline/cache/crawl/accounting/<id>/) contains them verbatim, plus live keyless probes
# that fail loudly if reality changes.
#
# Every URL below is in that product's products.json urls (or is quoted from a page that is);
# every excerpt quotes the crawled/fetched page (crawl and authoring on the same day,
# 2026-09-16).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - freshbooks: no llms.txt, no .md page mirrors, no MCP server, no official CLI (generic
#     probe negatives recorded). API docs are HTML-only but server-rendered.
#   - zoho-books: no llms.txt and no per-page .md mirrors on zoho.com; Zoho MCP is a
#     platform-level product (mcp.zoho.com is sign-in-gated; the marketing page and customer
#     quotes document Books coverage — quoted as such, not as a Books-hosted server).
#   - wave: developer.waveapps.com (the GraphQL API portal) answers HTTP 403 to
#     non-browser clients — a real crawl wall, recorded honestly rather than paraphrased
#     from memory; no llms.txt, no MCP, no CLI.
#   - digits: no official CLI; Digits MCP is READ-ONLY by the vendor's own docs (quoted
#     as-is); openapi is served from a docs index page, not a bare /openapi.json (the
#     generic probe's 404 on guessed paths stands).
#   - kick: NO public API — docs.kick.co has no API section at all (competitor Digits
#     claims the same; our own crawl corroborates), no OpenAPI, no official CLI. The only
#     machine surfaces are the GitBook-provided docs endpoints (llms.txt, .md mirrors,
#     ?ask= dynamic queries, and a keyless GitBook docs MCP at docs.kick.co/~gitbook/mcp)
#     — attributed to the docs platform in the excerpts.
#   - mercury-books: no Books API or Books MCP — docs.mercury.com and mcp.mercury.com
#     cover the BANKING product (its arena row is startup-banking/mercury); nothing from
#     those surfaces is cited here to avoid cross-product credit.
#   - bench: a human-plus-software bookkeeping service; no developer surface of any kind
#     (generic probe negatives recorded).
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline probe --category accounting --product <id>` (that stage wholesale-
# replaces probe-tier items; this script's probe items must be re-appended if it re-runs) and
# AFTER extract (extraction is monotonic and dedups by normalized excerpt).

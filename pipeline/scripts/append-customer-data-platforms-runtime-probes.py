# One-shot helper for the customer-data-platforms arena bring-up (2026-09-08): appends
# probe-tier evidence items distilled from the recorded runtime probes in
# data/customer-data-platforms/proofs/ (see pipeline/stages/probe-record.ts
# LOCAL_PROBES['customer-data-platforms'] — all 12 recorded probes passed). Run AFTER
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category customer-data-platforms` — that stage wholesale-replaces
# probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items (re-run this script after any probe refresh).

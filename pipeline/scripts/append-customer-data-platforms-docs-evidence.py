# One-shot helper for the customer-data-platforms arena bring-up (2026-09-08): appends
# claimed-docs evidence for mParticle capabilities the LLM extract pass surfaced only as thin
# nav-fragment excerpts (docs.mparticle.com is a Gatsby site whose giant sidebars dominate the
# per-source extraction budget). Every excerpt below is verbatim-verified on the cited URL on
# 2026-09-08 (thin-crawl-bias fix, same pattern as append-email-docs-evidence.py). Idempotent.

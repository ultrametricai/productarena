# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15): the identical Stripe-spike supplement recipe
# (append-payments-stripe-agentic-evidence.py, 771a7510; append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py,
# 277a7797) for team-chat/buzz. This wave's crawl added 15 buzz agent-surface urls.extra pages
# (AGENTS.md, NOSTR.md, VISION_AGENT/REMOTE_AGENTS, buzz-acp/buzz-agent/persona-pack/managed-skill,
# NIP-AA, admin API, agent benchmark, Helm chart, owned-agent discovery, git-credential-nostr,
# SECURITY.md); the extract run surfaced only 11 mostly one-line items from them. Every excerpt
# below quotes the crawled page verbatim (recon copies fetched 2026-09-15, same day as the crawl).
#
# Verified-honest absences (NO doc items added, on purpose — live-checked 2026-09-15):
#   - No hosted/remote MCP server: mcp.buzz.xyz does not resolve; buzz.xyz/mcp is 404. The MCP
#     surface is docs/MCP_DRIVEN_HOOKS.md (local hooks) + buzz-agent as MCP *client*.
#   - No llms.txt (buzz.xyz/llms.txt 404 — buzz-probe-1 already records this) and no
#     /.well-known/skills index or /.well-known/nostr.json on buzz.xyz.
#   - No published OpenAPI spec (buzz-probe-2 records the 404s); the machine spec surface is the
#     Nostr NIPs + docs/nips/* extensions instead.
#   - buzz-cli is NOT on crates.io ("crate `buzz-cli` does not exist") — CLI is build-from-source
#     (or the Desktop-bundled managed-agent copy); no brew/npm distribution either.
#   - openness-*/privacy-* axes untouched except where a crawled page speaks directly.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --category team-chat --product buzz` (extract is monotonic and
# dedups by normalized excerpt, so re-running extract after this keeps these items stable).

     'Buzz ships a root AGENTS.md — "AI Agent Contributor Guide... for AI agents contributing to the Buzz codebase" — with a Product Contract ("Before planning or reviewing a non-trivial change: Read VISION.md... Read the applicable guidance in TESTING.md"), the five-repo ecosystem map (block/buzz is "OSS source — relay, desktop app, mobile app, CLI, agent harness"), and the full crate map ("buzz-relay # WebSocket relay server — main entry point; also hosts git + huddle audio"). CLAUDE.md at the root points to AGENTS.md, and the repo mirrors vendor-shipped skills into .agents/, .claude/, .codex/, and .goose/skills/ so four agent harnesses discover them natively.'),
    # --- ACP harness: any ACP agent becomes a Buzz teammate (extra-19) ---
    ('buzz-supp-acp-harness', f'{RAW}/crates/buzz-acp/README.md',
     'buzz-acp is the "ACP harness that connects AI agents to Buzz. The harness listens for @mentions on the relay, prompts your agent, and the agent replies using the Buzz CLI... Supports any agent that speaks ACP over stdio: goose, codex (via codex-acp), and claude code (via claude-agent-acp)." Each agent gets its own first-class identity: "Each agent needs a Nostr keypair — this is the agent\'s identity in Buzz" (minted with `buzz-admin generate-key`, enrolled via `add-member`, which "publishes a kind:13534 membership event"), and "Running multiple agents? Mint a separate keypair for each."'),

     'buzz-agent is Block\'s own agent runtime: "Minimal, unbreakable ACP-compliant LLM agent. Stdio in, tool calls out." It is an MCP client by design — "A client sends session/prompt. The agent loops: call the LLM → get tool calls → run them via MCP → feed results back → repeat" — and is provider-agnostic: documented quick starts run it against "Anthropic Messages API, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compat (vLLM, llama.cpp, Databricks, Block Gateway, Ollama, …)" plus "Databricks model serving via OAuth 2.0 PKCE". VISION_AGENT.md pairs it with buzz-dev-mcp ("an MCP server. It gives any agent a shell and a file editor") — "two crates of Rust purpose-built for headless autonomous coding work."'),

Conversational agent management is first-class: "When someone naturally asks to create an agent, ask for at most two things: the agent\'s name and what it should do day-to-day... Then run: buzz agents draft-create --channel <current-channel-uuid> --display-name ... --system-prompt ..." — with an explicit owner-review gate: "The command sends an encrypted draft to the owner\'s Desktop. It does not create the agent until the owner reviews and saves the form, so report the result as \'ready for review,\' never \'created.\'"'),

     'Buzz publishes its own agent-credential spec, NIP-AA "Agent Authentication": "An agent whose owner is a relay member MAY gain implicit relay access — without being explicitly enrolled in the member list — by presenting a NIP-OA auth tag during NIP-42 authentication." It closes a documented revocation hazard: "When a human\'s membership is revoked, their agents remain enrolled until manually removed... NIP-AA closes this gap... If the owner\'s membership is later revoked, the agent\'s next connection attempt fails automatically — no separate cleanup required." Agent keys are distinct principals ("An AI agent, bot, or automation process with its own Nostr keypair") with RFC-2119 normative language.'),

The signer\'s pubkey is resolved against a two-tier principal model — Operator or Moderator — that grants capabilities accordingly." Token auth was deliberately removed ("BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN is no longer recognised... a stale token variable cannot silently run a deployment on a removed auth path"), and the API self-advertises for machine discovery: "the relay advertises the admin API origin in its NIP-11 relay-information document under an optional admin_api field."'),
    # --- remote agents: relay as the management plane (extra-18) ---
    ('buzz-supp-remote-agents', f'{RAW}/VISION_REMOTE_AGENTS.md',
     'Remote agents make headless operation the design center: "An agent in Buzz is more than just a process. It has a keypair, a name, a durable history, a reputation — all on the relay... after deploy, the desktop retains no substrate control channel... everything flows through the relay: you read the agent\'s messages to know how it\'s doing, you mention it to steer it, you tell a healthy agent to stop and it exits on its own." Substrates are pluggable behind a provider contract ("Kubernetes is the first substrate, not the point... preserve the agent\'s identity and fail closed with its key, converge to a single live instance no matter how deploys race... A conformance suite pins those behaviors").'),

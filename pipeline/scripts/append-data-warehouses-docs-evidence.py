# Data-warehouses arena bring-up (2026-09): supplements evidence packs with verbatim passages
# from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor docs that the LLM extraction passes kept missing — the kitty/
# auth-platforms precedent (append-kitty-docs-evidence.py, append-auth-docs-evidence.py):
# per-source extraction caps starve specific capabilities out of the prompt even though the
# corpus contains them verbatim. Every excerpt below quotes the cited vendor page (checked at
# authoring time, 2026-09-06). Extraction is monotonic and dedups by normalized excerpt, so
# re-running extract after this keeps these items stable. Compliance items were added for every
# product with a verifiable public attestations page (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery); no
# public MotherDuck compliance page was found, so it deliberately gets none.

# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15), edge-platforms lane: the identical supplement recipe to
# append-payments-stripe-agentic-evidence.py / append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py, for
# vercel and cloudflare. This wave's crawl added 20 vercel + 16 cloudflare agent-surface
# urls.extra pages; the monotonic extract runs surfaced +18 / +25 mostly one-line items. The
# verbatim passages below are content those crawled/verified pages contain that the per-source
# extraction caps and the 40-story quota starved out of the packs.
#
# Every URL below is in that product's products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe
# verifies); every excerpt quotes the crawled/live page (live-checked 2026-09-15, the same day
# the crawl ran; recon copies under /tmp/pa-edge-recon at authoring time).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - vercel: Vercel MCP has NO keyless mode — a bare JSON-RPC initialize gets HTTP 401
#     (vercel-probe-5), and the docs state "Vercel MCP only supports AI clients that have been
#     reviewed and approved by Vercel" (quoted with that restriction intact). Vercel Agent is
#     quoted with its public-beta + Pro/Enterprise availability intact. eve is quoted as Beta.
#   - cloudflare: no in-dashboard AI assistant page was found on the crawled surface — nothing
#     is claimed for one; the ONLY fully keyless Cloudflare MCP verified is the docs server
#     (cloudflare-probe-4); the Code Mode server is OAuth/API-token gated (cloudflare-probe-5),
#     quoted as such. Alpha/Beta labels are kept where the pages carry them.
#   - openness-*/privacy-*: out of this wave's scope; no agent-washing of unrelated axes.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --product <id>` (extraction is monotonic and dedups by
# normalized excerpt, so re-running extract after this keeps these items stable).

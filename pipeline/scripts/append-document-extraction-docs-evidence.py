# document-extraction arena bring-up (2026-09-10): supplements evidence packs with verbatim
# passages from the CRAWLED vendor docs that the LLM extraction pass missed — the kitty
# precedent (append-kitty-docs-evidence.py): per-source extraction caps starved the entire
# compliance/retention/deployment posture (SOC 2, HIPAA, ZDR, on-prem) out of every product's
# pack even though the crawled corpus contains it verbatim. Applied evenly across all six
# products. Every excerpt quotes pipeline/cache/crawl/document-extraction/<product>/*.md
# content (checked at authoring time); URLs are the crawled sources.

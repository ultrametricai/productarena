# One-shot helper for the metorial mcp-infrastructure bring-up (YC F25 coverage-queue wave
# 2026-09-25; queue classified agent-frameworks, re-based to mcp-infrastructure — morph
# precedent — because Metorial's surface IS this arena's axis: hosted MCP servers, provider
# registry, OAuth handling, session logs). Appends probe-tier evidence items distilled from the
# recorded runtime probes in data/mcp-infrastructure/proofs/metorial/ (see
# pipeline/probes/mcp-infrastructure.ts — all 3 recorded probes passed). Run AFTER
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category mcp-infrastructure --product metorial` (or a spike pass, whose
# probe stage wholesale-replaces probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items) — re-run this
# script after any probe refresh.

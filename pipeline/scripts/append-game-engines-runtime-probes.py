# Helper for the game-engines arena (bring-up 2026-09-15, accuracy wave 2026-09-23): upserts
# probe-tier evidence items distilled from the recorded runtime probes in
# data/game-engines/proofs/ (see pipeline/probes/game-engines.ts) plus MCP/CLI-landscape facts
# verified live via keyless GitHub/npm/UPM API calls (official vs community attribution
# matters — the founder asked for agenticness measured honestly). The 2026-09-23 wave added
# Unity's first-party CLI (`unity mcp` / `unity eval`, the announced replacement for the
# deprecated in-editor MCP server), Unity's keyless UPM registry, Epic's new-but-flaky
# llms.txt files, and Godot's built-in LSP counterweight. Run AFTER
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category game-engines` — that stage wholesale-replaces probe-tier
# evidence and would wipe these items.

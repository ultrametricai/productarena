# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15): Stripe-style exhaustive agent-surface evidence pass for
# RAMP, in BOTH arenas that track it — expense-management and startup-banking (separate packs:
# data/<arena>/evidence/ramp.json). Same supplement recipe as
# append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py: verbatim passages from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor
# pages that the per-source extraction caps plus the 40-story quota starved out of the packs.
# This wave's crawl added 12 expense-management and 18 startup-banking agent-surface urls.extra
# pages; extract surfaced only ~13/16 mostly one-line items from them.
#
# Every URL below is in that arena's ramp products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe
# verifies, or agents.ramp.com — live-verified 2026-09-15, served with a text/markdown alternate
# that the crawler's HTML converter would mangle, so it is quoted here instead of crawled).
#
# Verified-honest absences (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - No .md-suffix docs mirrors: docs.ramp.com HTML pages are JS shells (llms.txt says so
#     explicitly); the machine-readable surface is /llms-guides/*.txt + /llms-api.txt +
#     /llms-full.txt + /openapi/developer-api.json.
#   - No /.well-known/skills/index.json on ramp.com or docs.ramp.com (404 / JS shell,
#     checked 2026-09-15). Skills ship inside the CLI (`ramp skills`) and agents.ramp.com/skills.
#   - Bill approvals are NOT available via MCP ("Bill approvals aren't yet available via MCP")
#     — quoted with the gap intact.
#   - Ramp Data MCP "requires provisioned access" (partner program) — quoted with the gate.
#   - Incorporation API is "Private preview only", endpoints return 404 unless enabled — quoted
#     with the gate.
#   - demo-mcp.ramp.com (sample data) still requires OAuth (401 keyless, checked 2026-09-15);
#     only the Developer MCP (docs) server is fully unauthenticated.
#   - openness-*/privacy-*: out of this wave's scope; no agent-washing of unrelated axes.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --product ramp` in both arenas (extraction is monotonic and
# dedups by normalized excerpt, so re-running extract after this keeps these items stable). If
# `pnpm pipeline probe` ever wholesale-replaces probe-tier items, re-run this script to restore
# ramp-probe-4/5/6 (expense-management) and ramp-probe-4/5 (startup-banking).

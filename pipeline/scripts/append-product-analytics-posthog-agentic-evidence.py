# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15): the identical Stripe-spike / payments-fairness supplement
# recipe (append-payments-stripe-agentic-evidence.py, append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py)
# run for product-analytics/posthog. This wave's crawl added 20 posthog agent-surface urls.extra
# pages (posthog-ai, MCP tools reference, self-driving, skills store, AI wizard incl. --signup,
# AI observability + shipped agent skills, MCP Analytics, Replay Vision, Workflows, Slack app,
# PostHog Desktop, /query API, personal-API-key scopes, CDP destinations, batch exports,
# per-endpoint OpenAPI, services/mcp README, ai-plugin README); the monotonic re-extract surfaced
# 14 mostly one-line items. These verbatim supplements carry the content the per-source extraction
# caps starved out of the pack even though the crawled corpus contains it verbatim.
#
# Every URL below is in posthog's products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe verifies);
# every excerpt quotes the crawled/live page (fetched 2026-09-15, same day the crawl ran).
#
# Verified-honest absences (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - no llms-full.txt (posthog.com/llms-full.txt is 404) — llms.txt is a per-page .md index
#     instead, every docs page renders as markdown at URL + `.md`;
#   - no /.well-known/skills/index.json (unlike Stripe) — PostHog skills ship via the MCP skills
#     store and a GitHub release zip (posthog-probe-7), not a well-known machine catalog;
#   - the wizard's `--ci` mode is "turned off in published builds" (quoted below, gate kept);
#   - MCP Analytics and the Slack app carry Beta labels — quoted with labels intact;
#   - openness-*/privacy-* axes are out of this wave's scope; no agent-washing of unrelated axes.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --product posthog` (extract is monotonic and dedups by
# normalized excerpt, so re-running extract after this keeps these items stable). If
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category product-analytics` ever wholesale-replaces probe-tier items,
# re-run this script to restore posthog-probe-6/7.

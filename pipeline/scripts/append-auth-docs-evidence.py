# Auth-platforms arena bring-up (2026-09): supplements evidence packs with verbatim passages
# from the CRAWLED vendor docs that the LLM extraction pass missed — the kitty precedent
# (append-kitty-docs-evidence.py): giant single-page docs (Keycloak's 1.1MB server-admin guide)
# and per-source extraction caps starve specific capabilities out of the prompt even though the
# crawled corpus contains them verbatim. Every excerpt below quotes pipeline/cache/crawl/
# auth-platforms/<product>/*.md content (checked at authoring time); URLs are the crawled
# sources. Extraction is monotonic and dedups by normalized excerpt, so re-running extract
# after this keeps these items stable.

# Stripe agentic-capability spike (2026-09-14): supplements stripe's payments evidence pack with
# verbatim passages from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor pages that the LLM extraction pass kept missing
# — same precedent as append-startup-banking-mercury-evidence.py and
# append-api-quality-docs-evidence.py: per-source extraction caps (60k chars / 44 sources ≈ 1.4k
# chars per page) plus the 40-story quota starve specific capabilities out of the pack even
# though the crawled corpus contains them verbatim. This wave's crawl added 16 agent-surface
# pages (agents/plugin, skills, agentic-commerce/*, payments/machine + mpp, link-cli, directory,
# projects, data/analyze-with-ai, billing/token-billing, workbench + shell, event-destinations,
# keys/restricted-api-keys); a single extract run surfaced only ~10 one-line items from them.
# Every URL below is in stripe's products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe verifies);
# every excerpt quotes the crawled/live page (live-checked at authoring time, 2026-09-14 — the
# recon copies were fetched the same day the crawl ran).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - agentic-builtin-assistant: Stripe documents agent TOOLING (MCP, skills, plugin) for
#     external agents, but no public page documents a task-executing assistant built into the
#     Dashboard itself. Nothing to quote; the verdict stays whatever the judge rules on the
#     absence.
#   - openness-full-export / privacy-*: out of this wave's scope; no agent-washing of unrelated
#     axes.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --product stripe` (extraction is monotonic and dedups by
# normalized excerpt, so re-running extract after this keeps these items stable). If
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category payments` ever wholesale-replaces probe-tier items, re-run
# this script to restore stripe-probe-6/7.

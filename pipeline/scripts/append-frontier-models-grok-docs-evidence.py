# Grok (xAI) frontier-models bring-up (2026-09-23): supplements the grok evidence pack with
# verbatim passages from CRAWLED/VERIFIED docs.x.ai pages that the LLM extraction pass kept
# missing — the exact append-frontier-models-docs-evidence.py precedent (2026-09-22): the
# 40-story extraction cap over a 64-source corpus starves specific capabilities (pricing,
# rate limits, model lifecycle, retention controls) out of the prompt even though the corpus
# contains them verbatim. Every excerpt below quotes a page in
# pipeline/cache/crawl/frontier-models/grok/ fetched 2026-09-23 (grep-verified at authoring
# time). Churn from the follow-up re-judge is settled by
# revert-churn-frontier-models-supp-wave.ts (flips kept only when citing a -supp- id).

# Processors arena bring-up (2026-09): hand-verified claimed-docs evidence for the Snapdragon
# X2 Elite Extreme. qualcomm.com is a client-rendered React app — every fetcher in the pipeline
# (crawl UA, plain curl, WebFetch) receives a 6.9KB JS shell that literally says "You need to
# enable JavaScript to run this app", so the standard crawl→extract path has no corpus to work
# with (the same bot-wall class the Intel ARK note in data/experiments/processors.json records).
# Spec values below are the vendor's own published figures, verified via rendered browser fetch
# at the 2026-09-14 experiments curation (data/experiments/processors.json, same sourceUrl) and
# re-checked at bring-up. The JS-shell fact itself is recorded in the pack — recorded reality
# wins, and spec-transparency is a judged axis in this arena.

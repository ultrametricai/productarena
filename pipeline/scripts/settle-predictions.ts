// Prediction settlement: purely mechanical, no judgment involved. Re-derives the changelog
// from the committed score-history files (lib/changelog.ts — the same derivation /changelog
// renders) and settles every open question in data/predictions.json:
//   - 'yes' if the challenger's overtake event landed in [opensAt, settlesBy], citing the
//     exact changelog event in `settledBy`;
//   - 'no' once the deadline passes without one.
// Idempotent: settled questions are never touched again, and a run with nothing to settle
// writes nothing. See lib/predictions.ts's settleQuestions for the pure logic + tests.
//
// LLM-free; wired into .github/workflows/story-runner.yml after generate-predictions.ts.
//   pnpm tsx pipeline/scripts/settle-predictions.ts

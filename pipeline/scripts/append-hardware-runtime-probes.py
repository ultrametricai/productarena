# Processors + GPUs arena bring-up (2026-09): appends probe-tier evidence items distilled from
# the recorded keyless probes in data/{processors,gpus}/proofs/ (see pipeline/probes/
# {processors,gpus}.ts — hardware has no API/CLI/MCP surface, so the honest probes are
# spec-page liveness with an expected model string, two toolchain-docs liveness checks, and one
# recorded FINDING: Qualcomm's spec page serves a JS shell to any non-browser fetcher).
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline probe --category processors|gpus` — that stage wholesale-replaces
# probe-tier evidence and would wipe these items (re-run this script after any probe refresh).

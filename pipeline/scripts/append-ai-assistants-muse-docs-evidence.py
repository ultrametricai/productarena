# Muse (ai-assistants) crawl-gap fix, 2026-09-21 deep-index wave: supplements the evidence pack
# with verbatim passages from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor pages the LLM extraction pass missed —
# same precedent as append-api-quality-docs-evidence.py (per-source extraction caps starve
# specific capabilities out of the pack even though the corpus contains them verbatim).
# Context: the 2026-09-21 spike re-crawl of Muse's post-launch surface (marketing homepage now
# public; "How We Built Safety Into Muse" at research.meta.ai, the security.muse.ai redirect
# target, added to urls.extra) contains explicit first-party statements on (1) the model-
# training opt-out switch, (2) free inspect/edit/download of all VM files including memory,
# and (3) the Mac client + WhatsApp channel — but the judged cells privacy-no-training,
# training-opt-out, export-my-data, openness-full-export, and desktop-app were decided on a
# pack that lacked those lines. Every excerpt below is verbatim from the crawled page in
# pipeline/cache/crawl/ai-assistants/muse/ (checked at authoring time, 2026-09-21).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO items added, on purpose):
#   - voice-conversation / image-understanding: the privacy policy lists "text, voice, photos"
#     only as a data-inventory category, not a documented capability — cells stay as judged.
#   - agentic-public-api / api-*: muse.ai exposes no developer surface at all (llms.txt /docs
#     /api /openapi.json all 307 to the homepage; api.muse.ai 404s; no MCP well-knowns) —
#     the none/na cells are the honest reading, no probe recorded (ChatGPT/Claude precedent).

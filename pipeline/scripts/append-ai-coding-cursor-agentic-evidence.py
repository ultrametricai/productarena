# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15): Stripe-style exhaustive agentic-surface evidence pass
# for ai-coding/cursor — same supplement recipe as append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py
# (commit 277a7797) and the Stripe spike (771a7510). This wave's crawl added 30 cursor
# agent-surface urls.extra pages (CLI/headless/ACP, Cloud Agents API v1 + webhooks +
# automations + self-hosted, Admin/Analytics/AI-Code-Tracking APIs, service accounts, hooks/
# rules/skills/subagents, Bugbot, run modes, TypeScript SDK, Origin, privacy governance,
# worktrees, OpenTelemetry export, BYO API keys); re-extract surfaced 31 mostly one-line items.
# Every URL below is in cursor's products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe verifies);
# every excerpt quotes the crawled/live page (fetched 2026-09-15, same day as the crawl).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - No Cursor-hosted remote MCP SERVER: mcp.cursor.com does not resolve (DNS NXDOMAIN,
#     live-checked 2026-09-15); Cursor is a documented MCP CLIENT (docs/mcp.md) and cloud
#     agents can consume MCP servers, but there is no server for third-party agents to drive
#     Cursor over MCP.
#   - Closed source: no open license, no self-hosting of the product; openness-* axes stay as
#     judged (Origin is a hosted forge, not self-hostable source).
#   - No API sandbox environment documented for the Cursor APIs (no test-mode keys).
#   - Cloud Agents API v1 is quoted with its "public beta" label; v1 webhooks are "coming
#     soon" — only the legacy v0 API supports webhooks today (quoted as such).
#   - Enterprise gates kept: Admin/Analytics/AI-Code-Tracking/Bugbot APIs and service accounts
#     and OpenTelemetry Export are Enterprise-plan features (quoted with the gate).
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --category ai-coding --product cursor` (extract is monotonic
# and dedups by normalized excerpt). If a probe stage ever wholesale-replaces probe-tier items,
# re-run this script to restore cursor-probe-2..5.

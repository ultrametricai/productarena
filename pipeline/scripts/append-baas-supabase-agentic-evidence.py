# Hot-repos fairness wave (2026-09-15): Stripe-style exhaustive agentic-surface evidence pass for
# backend-as-a-service/supabase — same supplement recipe as
# append-payments-fairness-agentic-evidence.py (commit 277a7797). This wave's crawl added 19
# supabase agent-surface urls.extra pages (ai-tools stack, MCP .md mirror, plugins, agent skills,
# byo-mcp, webhooks/cron/queues, backups/PITR, FTS, image transforms, api-keys, MFA/SAML,
# advisors, security, logs, dashboard AI assistant); the monotonic extract surfaced ~23 mostly
# one-line items from them. This script appends the verbatim passages the per-source extraction
# caps starved out, plus 2 live keyless probes that fail loudly if reality changes.
#
# Every URL below is in supabase's products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe verifies);
# every excerpt quotes the crawled/live page (crawl + live checks ran 2026-09-15).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - no first-party offline-first sync product is documented (offline-first-sync stands as
#     judged; community options like PowerSync are third-party).
#   - no public API deprecation/versioning-policy page was found (Management API is /v1 and the
#     Data API rides PostgREST, but there is no documented deprecation policy) —
#     api-versioning-policy is left to the judge with no supplement.
#   - the CI/PAT path to the MCP server is quoted WITH its coarse-grained caveat ("for now all
#     scopes are required"); the 13 granular OAuth scopes shown by probe-10 apply to the OAuth
#     login flow, not PATs.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --category backend-as-a-service --product supabase` (extract
# is monotonic and dedups by normalized excerpt, so re-running extract keeps these items stable).

# Payments fairness wave (2026-09-14): the integrity counterpart to the Stripe agentic-capability
# spike (append-payments-stripe-agentic-evidence.py, commit 771a7510). Stripe got an exhaustive
# agent-surface evidence pass; its direct competitors' scores were still sitting on the same
# extraction caps. This script runs the IDENTICAL supplement recipe for adyen, paypal, and
# square: verbatim passages from CRAWLED/VERIFIED vendor pages that the per-source extraction
# caps (60k chars over 24-26 sources) plus the 40-story quota starved out of the packs even
# though the crawled corpus contains them verbatim. This wave's crawl added 11 adyen, 9 paypal,
# and 10 square agent-surface urls.extra pages; the extract runs surfaced only ~19/18/18
# mostly one-line items from them.
#
# Every URL below is in that product's products.json urls (or is the live endpoint a probe
# verifies); every excerpt quotes the crawled/live page (live-checked at authoring time,
# 2026-09-14 — the recon copies were fetched the same day the crawl ran).
#
# Verified-honest counterparts (NO doc items added, on purpose):
#   - adyen: no official CLI, no hosted/remote MCP server (the documented MCP is local-only via
#     `npx @adyen/mcp`), no llms-full agent-instructions block; nothing to quote for
#     agentic-builtin-assistant (no in-product assistant documented).
#   - paypal: no official CLI; agentic commerce services are gated behind a contact form
#     (quoted as-is, gate included); no in-product Dashboard assistant documented.
#   - square: no official CLI; no documented seller-side agentic-commerce catalog protocol
#     (UCP/ACP participation not documented for Square sellers — unlike Stripe/Adyen/PayPal);
#     Square AI is quoted with its Beta label intact.
#   - openness-*/privacy-*: out of this wave's scope; no agent-washing of unrelated axes.
#
# Run AFTER `pnpm pipeline extract --product <id>` (extraction is monotonic and dedups by
# normalized excerpt, so re-running extract after this keeps these items stable). If
# `pnpm pipeline probe --category payments` ever wholesale-replaces probe-tier items, re-run
# this script to restore adyen-probe-5, paypal-probe-4/5, and square-probe-5/6.

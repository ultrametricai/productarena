// Reconciles judge-cache hashes left stale by the 2026-09-11 integrations-directory
// enrichment (commit 54b6a895): that wave appended {product}-intdir-N claimed-docs evidence
// to 35 products as integration-graph fuel, deliberately leaving verdicts untouched — but the
// judge cache key hashes the FULL evidence pack, so every touched product's cells went stale
// and any later `pnpm pipeline judge --category <cat>` run fails at the assembly staleness
// check (first hit: the 2026-09-14 linear api-quality fix, blocked on asana's stale cells).
//
// Why restamp instead of re-judge: the established churn policy (revert-churn.ts /
// revert-churn-api-quality-wave.ts) reverts any re-rolled cell whose verdict or quality
// changed while citing NO evidence id that is new to the pack. For these products the pack's
// only post-judge additions (the intdir items) are already committed — nothing is "new"
// relative to the committed baseline — so a re-roll + churn-revert provably converges back to
// the committed verdicts with only the hash refreshed. This script jumps straight to that
// fixed point at zero LLM cost: same verdict object, hash restamped to the current pack.
//
// Safety: a cell is only restamped when the cached verdict is byte-identical (deep equal) to
// the committed verdicts.json row — any mismatch aborts, because then the cache and verdicts
// have diverged for a reason this script must not paper over.
//
// Usage: pnpm exec tsx pipeline/scripts/restamp-judge-cache-intdir.ts [--write]
//   (no --write: dry run, prints the plan only; --write: applies changes to disk)

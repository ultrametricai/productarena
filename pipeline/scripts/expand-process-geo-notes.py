# One-off (2026-09-29 geo-mapping lane, founder ask: "go map the processes in the countries we
# tried to spike so the geo switcher works"): expand geoNotes from 12 processes / 31 notes to
# honest UK/IN/DE/FR coverage across the US-scoped processes AND the jurisdictionally-flavored
# global ones (founder agreement, offboarding, invoicing, accounting, data protection, …).
# Conventions inherited from tag-process-geo.py: every actionUrl curl-verified live before
# listing (browser UA where hosts bot-block); when an official host blocks (mca.gov.in 403,
# legifrance 403, infogreffe/data.inpi.fr Cloudflare, france-visas challenge, esic.gov.in
# unreachable, shcilestamp 403), the NSWS-substitution precedent applies: substitute the
# nearest verifiable official portal or write no note — never fabricate. Countries with no
# true analog get NO note (the honest banner says so). Run from the repo root.

// One-time migration for ProductArena's Accuracy Program wave 1: appends the new canonical
// `agentic-mcp-client` story (pipeline/agentic-stories.ts) to every category's stories.json.
//
// Why a separate migration instead of just re-running normalize: normalize.ts refuses to
// touch a category with real (non-SAMPLE) verdicts, and re-normalizing would also churn every
// LLM-authored story. This script does the minimal, auditable thing: add the one new
// canonical id, stamp it with `origin: {kind: 'canonical', recordedAt}` (same contract as
// migrate-story-origin.ts), and re-sort the file by theme → group → id so it matches the
// invariant assembleTaxonomy() would have produced.
//
// Cache safety: judge.ts's cellHash() only hashes storyId + title + evidence + promptVersion,
// so adding a brand-new story id never collides with an existing cache entry — the new cells
// simply have no cache file yet and `pnpm pipeline judge` will judge them fresh (expected: 53
// new cells across the 10 categories, one per product).

# Opus 5.5 judge-migration status — live tracker

_Last updated 2026-10-01T21:43:28.204Z by the migration lane. Deleted when the migration doc (docs/JUDGE-MIGRATION-2026-09-30.md) supersedes it, or kept as the wave record._

| | |
|---|---|
| Arenas done / remaining | 94 ingested+committed / 0 in flight (of 94; ai-coding included in done) |
| Cells re-judged so far | 33,789 |
| Cumulative ingested spend | $570.84 (hard stop $800) |
| Projected fleet ingest total | ~$571 (+ interactive fallbacks + ~$10–25 uncertainty re-measure) |
| Fleet exact agreement vs sonnet-5 (running) | 75.5% (8,272 flips / 33,789 comparable cells) |
| Batch requests / interactive fallbacks | 32,753 / 18 |

Churn-policy flag: the no-new-evidence revert rule is deliberately NOT applied to this wave
(README §7); every flip is labeled `judge model migration` via the score-history `note`.
Protected human adjudications (18 cells) re-applied per docs/JUDGE-MIGRATION-2026-09-30-worklist.json.

# Vendor radar

Founder ask (2026-10-02): *"we need a way not to miss new vendors that are hot and coming out —
listen for new vendor launches and do a deep spike on them when they come out, so this data set
is alive."*

The radar is the LISTENING half of that ask: a keyless daily scan of public launch surfaces that
reports new, hot, arena-relevant vendors as candidates. The SPIKE half stays exactly what it
already is — a deliberate, reviewed run of the standard pipeline on a human-approved candidate.

## The no-auto-judge rule

**The radar never auto-adds products and never auto-judges.** It is detection only: nothing under
`data/` changes from a radar run. Rankings on this site are evidence-graded verdicts; a product
enters them only through the full bring-up (research → roster PR → keyed
crawl → extract → probe → judge → claims → derive), each step reviewable. The radar's output is a
report and an issue — paper, not verdicts. This rule is stated in the issue template text, the
report `_comment`, and the workflow header, on purpose, three times.

## How it works

`pipeline/scripts/vendor-radar.ts`, run daily by `.github/workflows/vendor-radar.yml`
(cron `31 8 * * *`, offset from the other automation loops):

1. **Scan** three keyless public launch surfaces (a handful of HTTP requests total, polite UA,
   10s timeouts; a source that fails to answer degrades to zero items with an honest `error`
   note in the report — never a fabricated item):
   - **Hacker News** via the Algolia search API (keyless by design): `Show HN` and `"Launch HN"`
     stories from the last `HN_LOOKBACK_DAYS`, plus front-page stories whose title is
     launch-shaped (`isLaunchTitle`). Hotness = points (`HN_MIN_POINTS`), with a velocity
     fast-path for very fresh stories (`HN_FAST_MIN_POINTS` at `HN_FAST_MIN_POINTS_PER_HOUR`).
   - **Product Hunt** public frontpage Atom feed (`producthunt.com/feed`, no key, one fetch —
     the feed PH publishes for exactly this consumption). Frontpage presence IS the hotness
     evidence; vote counts are not exposed keylessly and the report says so verbatim rather
     than inventing them.
   - **GitHub** repo search API (one request; keyless rate limits respected, `GH_TOKEN` used for
     the higher authenticated limit when present): repos created in the last
     `GITHUB_LOOKBACK_DAYS` with ≥ `GITHUB_MIN_STARS` stars, kept only when star velocity
     crosses `GITHUB_MIN_STARS_PER_DAY`.
2. **Match** each hot item's text (title / tagline / description / topics) against the arena
   taxonomy: `DOMAIN_VOCAB` (`pipeline/scripts/tag-story-scopes.ts` — the same per-arena nouns
   `yc-coverage-queue.ts` matches with), extended per arena with its `data/categories.json`
   name tokens and its `data/arena-sections.json` section-name tokens. `MIN_ARENA_HITS`
   distinct keyword hits are required — a hot launch that speaks no arena's language is not our
   vendor. Lexical matching is a NOMINATION signal, never a verdict input.
3. **Dedupe**, so each candidate surfaces exactly once, ever:
   - every tracked product (`data/<arena>/products.json`) by normalized site domain
     (`pipeline/yc-shared.ts` `normalizeDomain`) and by normalized name/id,
   - the vendor registry (`vendors/reviews/generated/`) by product id,
   - the committed seen-ledger **`pipeline/radar-seen.json`**: every candidate ever reported,
     keyed by product domain (or `github:owner/repo` / normalized name when no product domain is
     public). `firstSeen` is the honest date of the run that first reported it — never backdated.
4. **Report**: `reports/vendor-radar/<date>.json` (schema-validated) + `<date>.md`, committed via
   the usual PR-or-issue flow. When there are NEW candidates the workflow also files (or, on a
   same-day re-run, comments on) a **`vendor-radar: candidates YYYY-MM-DD`** issue
   (label `story-runner`) listing each candidate with its evidence links, matched arenas, and the
   action line: *a deep spike on approved candidates runs via the standard pipeline — approve by
   checking the box / commenting.*

## Tuning keywords and thresholds

- **Thresholds** are named constants at the top of `pipeline/scripts/vendor-radar.ts`
  (`HN_MIN_POINTS`, `GITHUB_MIN_STARS_PER_DAY`, `MIN_ARENA_HITS`, `MAX_REPORT_CANDIDATES`, …) and
  are echoed into every report's `thresholds` block, so a threshold change is visible in the
  report diff that follows it.
- **Keywords**: to make an arena match better, extend its `DOMAIN_VOCAB` entry in
  `pipeline/scripts/tag-story-scopes.ts` (tight, domain-strong nouns only — generic words swallow
  everything; see the vocabulary's own header comment). Arenas without a `DOMAIN_VOCAB` entry
  still match on their `categories.json` name tokens and section-name tokens via
  `buildArenaVocab`.
- **Noise control**: raising `MIN_ARENA_HITS` cuts false positives fleet-wide; the per-report cap
  `MAX_REPORT_CANDIDATES` keeps the issue readable (overflow is counted honestly in
  `skipped.overflow`, and uncapped candidates simply surface on a later run since only REPORTED
  candidates enter the seen-ledger).
- A candidate that was wrongly skipped can be re-surfaced by deleting its row from
  `pipeline/radar-seen.json` (a reviewed commit, like everything else).

## From candidate to judged product (the Instinct/dots precedent)

Approving a radar candidate starts the same deliberate flow the Instinct and OpenAI-dots
bring-ups used (`docs/vendor-research/instinct.md`, `docs/vendor-research/ai-assistants-candidates.md`):

1. **Research doc** — `docs/vendor-research/<vendor>.md`: what it is, which arena, capability map
   with per-claim source URLs, fetch dates, and evidence tiers (`claimed-docs` / `press` /
   `probe`). No judging, no rankings edits — raw material for the evidence pack.
2. **Roster PR** — add the product to `data/<arena>/products.json` (reviewed like any roster
   change; disclosure rules apply if owner-affiliated).
3. **The deep spike** — a keyed standard-pipeline run on that product/arena:
   `crawl → extract → collect-community → probe → judge → claims → derive` (via
   `pipeline/cli.ts`, story-runner dispatch, or `pipeline/scripts/spike-engine.ts --process`),
   landing as a PR reviewed under the re-judge stability policy.
4. Close the candidate's checkbox in the radar issue with a link to the PR.

The radar only ever shortens the time between "it launched" and step 1.

## Testing

`pipeline/__tests__/vendor-radar.test.ts` — pure units only, no network: fake HN/PH/GitHub
fixtures → arena matches, hotness thresholds, dedupe against tracked products and the
seen-ledger, same-key cross-source merging, and the report/issue shape (schema round-trip, the
checkbox action line, the no-auto-judge statement). The committed inaugural run under
`reports/vendor-radar/` is the end-to-end integration evidence.

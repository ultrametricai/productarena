// Pure, display-only parsing of user-story text. Every canonical story title is authored in
// the Connextra frame — "As a(n) {persona}, {clause}" (see pipeline/agentic-stories.ts,
// normalize.ts, depth-mine.ts's commonRules) — which reads fine once but is deafeningly
// repetitive down a list: the arena tables were fifty rows of "As a developer, …". This module
// splits that frame into a persona label (chip/column/filter material) and a standalone action
// sentence, WITHOUT ever touching the stored Story.title: judge caching keys on the exact
// title (pipeline/stages/judge.ts's cellHash includes it), so data files and the canonical
// text are never mutated — presentation-layer derivation only.
//
// Node-builtin-free and pure so both client components (StoryVerdictsTable, CompareBuilder)
// and server renderers (llms.md, checklist markdown) can share it, and so the parsed persona
// can later back a filter without re-plumbing story data.

export interface ParsedStory {

  // "a"/"an" article dropped — lowercasing dedupes the authored casing drift ("As a Founder"
  // vs "as a founder", "AI-native user" vs "ai-native user") so chips and future filters treat
  // equal personas as equal. Null when the text doesn't match the Connextra frame.
  persona: string | null
  // The story minus its persona frame, reading as a standalone sentence: first-person leads
  // ("I want to " / "I need to " / "I can " / "I know " / "I'd like to ") are dropped and the
  // first letter capitalized, while any "so that {benefit}" clause is kept — the benefit is
  // part of the action's meaning, not the persona's. Equals the original text (unchanged)
  // when no persona parses out.

// Defensive missing-comma variant ("As an ops lead I want to deploy…"): the persona ends where
// the first-person clause starts. Anchored to a real first-person lead so a title like
// "As a rule the parser stays out of prose" can never mint a bogus persona.

// First-person leads that add no meaning once the action stands alone. "I want/need (to)",
// "I can", "I'd like to" are the classic Connextra verbs; "I know" is the variant
// depth-mine.ts authors for pricing/limits stories. Leads like "I get"/"I see"/"I run" are
// deliberately NOT stripped — dropping them would leave a noun phrase, not a sentence.
const LEAD = /^I(?: want to| need to| can| know|'d like to| would like to)\s+/i

// A real persona is a short noun phrase ("switcher", "data platform lead", "developer using
// the API"). Anything longer is almost certainly prose that happens to start with "As a …" —
// bail out rather than mint a paragraph-long "persona".

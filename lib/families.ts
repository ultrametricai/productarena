// Product families (data/product-families.json): one entry per multi-product vendor whose
// lines are genuinely separate experiences (Stripe → Payments/Terminal/Billing/Atlas…,
// Mercury → banking/cards/invoicing, Block → Square/Cash App). A family is a DISPLAY-ONLY
// breakdown rendered at /family/[id]: it never feeds lib/scoring.ts, and a sub-product judged
// into an arena competes there on the same stories as everyone else — the family page just
// aggregates the deep links.
//
// Two kinds of sub-product line:
//   - arenaRef set → the line is judged as its own product in that arena (Stripe Terminal in
//     mobile-payments); the family page pulls its live rank/PA Score from that arena's
//     rankings and deep-links to the product page and its battles.
//   - arenaRef null → breakdown-page-only: no existing arena genuinely fits the line as a
//     competitor. Rendered as an honest "not yet judged" state; the optional `note` says why
//     (no fitting arena, or the capability is already scored inside the parent's own entry).
//
// The optional Product.familyId field (lib/schemas.ts) is a denormalized back-reference from
// products.json onto these entries; lib/__tests__/families.test.ts keeps both directions in
// sync and every arenaRef pointing at a real judged product.

// Per-product improvement opportunities, derived purely from the product's OWN judged verdicts:
// every story judged none or partial is something the vendor could ship (or evidence better),
// ranked by how much score headroom it represents. This is the vendor-facing complement to the
// verdicts table — "here is your to-do list, straight from the evidence" — and it complements
// the vendor-response lane (docs/VENDOR-RESPONSES.md) and the per-verdict Flag link: if a
// verdict here is wrong, contest it; if it's right, close it.
//
// Pure and `node:fs`-free (same contract as lib/data-helpers.ts): callers pass the stories +
// verdicts (any CategoryData satisfies the input shape), tests pass fixtures.
//
// Ranking formula (honest and contestable, like everything else on the site):
//
//   impact = story.weight × (10 − quality) × boost
//
// where quality is the judged 0–10 quality (0 for none) and boost = AGENTIC_BOOST for stories
// in the three index-feeding agenticness groups (agent-access → agent-ready, agentic-features →
// Built-in AI, api-quality → API quality — see lib/scoring.ts), because closing those gaps moves
// a headline index directly, not just the coverage score. `na` verdicts are excluded entirely:
// "not applicable" is not an opportunity.

// Curated "builds-on" DAG over the canonical lens stories (data/story-graph.json), zod-validated
// at module load so a malformed edit fails the build, not the reader. The graph is hand-authored
// — stories aren't flat: you can't have webhooks without an API, MCP presumes programmatic
// access, headless presumes a CLI — and components/StoryMap.tsx renders it as the canon half of
// the per-product story map. Structural invariants beyond the schema (every id canonical, the
// clusters partition the canon exactly, edges stay inside one cluster, no cycles) live in
// lib/__tests__/storyGraph.test.ts rather than here: the canon ids come from
// pipeline/agentic-stories.ts, which must not leak into the app bundle.

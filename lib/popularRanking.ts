// Pure segmentation + hot-detection logic for the /rankings/popular page and the 🔥 chip.

// pipeline/stages/popularity.ts: no node builtins, so client components and tests import it

//
// FAIRNESS is the design constraint. You cannot rank GitHub stars against a closed SaaS
// product's adoption — they are different instruments measuring different populations — so
// popularity is presented as SEGMENTS that are never blended into one number:
//   (a) star-tracked products ranked by absolute stars (velocity shown alongside),
//   (b) package-installed products ranked by weekly npm+PyPI installs (same unit, so the sum
//       across the two registries is honest),
//   (c) curated "clearly popular" products with NO public counter (data/popular-products.json)
//       rendered as an UNRANKED strip — an editorial fact, never a fake number.
// Missing data is absent, never zero, and none of this ever touches the PA Score (see
// METHODOLOGY.md "Popularity — a signal, not a score").

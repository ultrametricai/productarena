// The 83(b) money math (founder directive 2026-10-01: "go super deep on business logic —
// tax mechanics, everything"). deadlines.ts owns the 30-day clock
// (election83bWindow, rule us-fed.83b-filing-period); THIS module owns the dollars.
//
// Pure, client-safe, deterministic. The arithmetic is Rev. Proc. 2012-29's own —
// rule `us-fed.83b-scenario-arithmetic` cites it, and the vitest gate
// (lib/openstartup/__tests__/election83b.test.ts) replays all six published examples
// number-for-number (25,000 shares, $25,000 paid / $0 paid, $40,000 vesting FMV, $60,000
// sale, the $25,000 repurchase forfeiture, and the no-loss $0-paid forfeiture).
//
// Interfaces consumed from the equity lane (vesting/anti-dilution/409A-method mechanics
// live there): vesting arrives as PLAIN INPUTS — the vesting-date FMV scenario values and
// share counts are explicit hypotheticals the caller supplies (a vesting schedule's output),
// and the early-exercise flag (`earlyExercised`) is the equity lane's; what that flag does
// to § 83 timing is computed here.
//
// Honest-scope notes:
// - TAX OUTCOMES DEPEND ON FACTS: every result is needsReview: true, educational, never
//   an authorization to file an election (which is irrevocable without IRS consent — rule
//   us-fed.83b-revocation).
// - Rates are INPUTS (ordinary and capital-gains rates as explicit hypotheticals); the
//   module never claims a current rate table.
// - FMV trajectories are labeled hypothetical scenarios. The module never invents an FMV.
// - The risk statement is the cited one: forfeit after electing and the income inclusion
//   is never recovered — no deduction, no credit, loss only to the extent amount paid
//   exceeds amount realized (Rev. Proc. 2012-29 § 4.03, Examples 3 and 6).

// Employer-side federal payroll tax mechanics (founder directive 2026-10-01). FEDERAL
// ONLY, by stated boundary: state unemployment insurance, state disability, local payroll
// taxes, and workers' compensation are OUT OF SCOPE — they exist, they are material, and
// this module says so rather than pretending a federal number is the loaded cost.
//
// Pure, client-safe, deterministic. Every rate and threshold is an asOf-dated parameter
// object backed by a rule card in rules/US-FED/ citing the live-verified IRS guidance:
// - us-fed.fica-rates-2026 — Pub 15 (2026): social security 6.2% each on the $184,500
//   wage base; Medicare 1.45% each, no limit; Additional Medicare 0.9% withheld from
//   employees only over $200,000 (NO employer share).
// - us-fed.futa-2025 — Instructions for Form 940 (2025): 6.0% on the first $7,000, up to
//   5.4% state credit (net 0.6%, at most $42/employee), credit-reduction states flagged.
// The vitest gate (lib/openstartup/__tests__/payrollTax.test.ts) hand-derives the
// published maxima from the cited figures (employer social security max 6.2% x $184,500 =
// $11,439; full-credit FUTA max 0.6% x $7,000 = $42) and checks the piecewise arithmetic.
//
// Interfaces: salaries arrive as explicit annual wage inputs (the runway/hiring modules'
// outputs can feed them); this module never derives compensation. Everything is
// needsReview: true — wage bases and credit-reduction lists change every year, deposit
// schedules and Form 941/940 mechanics are separate obligations, and nothing here
// authorizes a deposit, filing, or withholding setup. Educational, not tax advice.

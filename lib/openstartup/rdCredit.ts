// R&D tax mechanics, honest scope (founder directive 2026-10-01): § 174/§ 174A
// capitalization/amortization arithmetic as cited explanation + straight-line math from
// explicit inputs, and the § 41(h) payroll-tax-offset election MECHANICS. This module
// computes NOTHING about whether research qualifies and never computes the credit amount
// itself — those are § 41(d) facts and Form 6765 elections (the rule cards' caveats).
//
// Pure, client-safe, deterministic. Rule cards (rules/US-FED/, primary sources verified
// live 2026-10-01):
// - us-fed.research-expenditure-amortization — current § 174 (foreign, 15-year, midpoint)
//   + § 174A (domestic, deductible after 2024, elective >= 60-month amortization) + the
//   PRIOR domestic 5-year midpoint regime for taxable years beginning 2022-2024 recorded
//   from the amendment notes. LAW IN FLUX: the card records what the cited text said on
//   its checked date — this module never editorializes currentness.
// - us-fed.rd-payroll-offset — § 41(h) QSB election ($250,000, +$250,000 for taxable
//   years beginning after 2022), § 3111(f), and the Form 8974 quarterly mechanics
//   (first-quarter-after-filing start; SS-first-then-Medicare; carryforward).
//
// The midpoint convention, made explicit: amortizing "ratably over the N-year period
// beginning with the midpoint of the taxable year" gives a HALF year of amortization in
// year one (1/2N of the amount), full years (1/N) in years 2..N, and the remaining half
// year in year N+1. For the 5-year domestic regime that is the published 10/20/20/20/20/10
// pattern ($100,000 -> $10,000 in year one), replayed in the tests.
//
// Honest-scope notes: eligibility is ALWAYS needs_review; amounts are asOf-dated; every
// result is educational decision support, never an authorization to deduct, elect, or
// file. State R&D credits are out of scope entirely.
